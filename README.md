# Project

This is basically a part of our main project.
Video.py contains the code using which Objects are detected in real time from video feeds. ImageAI library is used for the detection. The detected objects are cropped using properties of roi and opencv. It is saved to another folder.
License.py holds the code for Number plate recognition and text extraction.
